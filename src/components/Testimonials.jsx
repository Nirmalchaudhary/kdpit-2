              Charusat by providing various facilities to the students has proved that it is not only being study
              oriented university. The counselling batches assigned to the respective faculties has been an
              initiative that has helped the students at various points in their college life. Along with the
              platforms that it provides to enhance the co-curricular skills is pretty good.

              I had joined a very early batch of BEIT program in 2002, still in the nascent stage worrying about how
              this new institute will fare among all other older and experienced ones. Surprisingly, with well
              equipped Computer workshops and very young and dynamic teaching staff, we were at par and sometimes
              better than most of the well established institutions in Gujarat.

              The friendly environment of the IT department provides a great opportunity for the student to think
              and grow as an engineer. I especially like the flexibility of the department. As and when the
              department gets any of the suggestions from industry, alumni, and students, the implementation starts
              as soon as possible. Department of IT, CSPIT is one of the great choices to grow as a good engineer.

              Being a part of the CSPIT-IT department has been an amazing experience of my life. The department
              faculties support me in every possible direction I tried to explore. Being a Data science enthusiast I
              got to work with cutting-edge state-of-the-art technologies like Nvidia Jetson TX2 and Nvidia Titan X
              at the department. I got exposure to nourish my management skills being a department representative
              for the Executive Central Council. I also got an opportunity to lead a project for preparing a <a

              department. Department also supported for multiple cross-country hackathons. Apart from this, I got
              exposure to be part of amazing projects in terms of working with AWS cloud, Novel IoT hardware
              projects, Opportunities to host multiple events like debate, volunteer for workshops and more. All of
              these were possible by the guidance of the counselor assigned to small batches of students to micro
              monitor and guide every student.

              impressed me. It instilled in me many new skills and provided me with opportunities to enhance my
              knowledge as well as to express it in a much efficient way, making me an excellent fit for the

              opportunities and above all the freedom to innovate and experiment my ideas under the guidance of

              Being a part of Charusat University was a brilliant experience. Aside from Charusat University, I'd
              like to point out that selecting the IT department was the finest option I made. Because the IT
              department's staff is incredibly helpful and treats all students equally. They also provided us with
              good advice on even small issues. I'd also want to point out that faculties offer assistance and
              guidance as part of the project or in the situation of any issues. The department provides knowledge
              of each new technology to its student in order to keep updated with new technologies. It was truly an
              honor for me to be able to contribute as an alumnus.

              subjects and upcoming technology was also covered to guide the students for their further study. I'd
              like to say that if you want to study in the IT branch then study at Charusat University.

              A department that feels like a second home. Starting from being helpful, all the teachers have given
              priority to building our personalities as a whole. My experience with the IT department is and will be
              the most cheerful one, from academics to sports, co-curricular activities and events that helped us
              shape our tomorrow. I have not only been limited to college facilities, but the industrial visits and
              the number of internships offered gave me a better understanding of the real picture of the industry.

              Apart from the academics and the opportunities, I would love to highlight the strength of the
              department that stands up during tech and non tech fests. The teachers, students, HoD sir, and
              everyone involved with us worked as a joint unit to make us feel home. College will always remain a
              home away from home.

              To all the freshers of this year, you are going to have the best roller coaster ride, some experiences
              might shine a light and others might not, but there is one thing that you have you remember, you are
              stronger than you think.

              computer labs, classrooms are the best which is one of the major parts in students development and
              academics. During this pandemic, our faculties worked very hard and took care of each and every
              student that he/she is understanding topics that are taught in daily online classes. Though we were
              studying and attending lectures from our home, our teachers always taught the same as they normally

              IT department gives a friendly environment and also faculties are very friendly they are always ready
              to help. Department is not always focusing on theory learning they are giving practical knowledge as
              well. There is not the only study in the department there are so many activities as well from that
              students can learn so many things. Being a part of the IT department it's a very great experience.

              The IT department assuages the process of learning through their teaching methodologies and friendly
              behaviour. The faculties expose students to all the upcoming technologies, events and opportunities of
              the real world which enormously helps the students and keeps them aware. It is my sheer honour to be a
              part of this department and learn new skills everyday.
