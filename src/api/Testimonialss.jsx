    "description":" I had joined a very early batch of BEIT program in 2002, still in the nascent stage worrying about how this new institute will fare among all other older and experienced ones. Surprisingly, with well equipped Computer workshops and very young and dynamic teaching staff, we were at par and sometimes better than most of the well established institutions in Gujarat."

Apart from this, I got exposure to be part of amazing projects in terms of working with AWS cloud, Novel IoT hardware projects, Opportunities to host multiple events like debate, volunteer for workshops and more. All of these were possible by the guidance of the counselor assigned to small batches of students to micro monitor and guide every student.`

It instilled in me many new skills and provided me with opportunities to enhance my knowledge as well as to express it in a much efficient way, making me an excellent fit for the professional world and overall a better person. Here, I got ample time to explore, some being my academic explorations, research projects, leadership opportunities, management skills, event handling opportunities and above all the freedom to innovate and experiment my ideas under the guidance of expert faculty members. It always felt like home because of parentlike and always-available-to-help mentors. To all the new-comers, I would advise you to grab every opportunity you get and explore every innovative idea that crosses your way. Never to settle for second-best is what this department and university has taught me!"
